# Data Visualisation Project

The project inspired from the article here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/

The dataset is present here: https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/ --> comic-characters

Coding is done using R language. Rmd file as well as md file of the code is uploaded.
The code and walkthrough is present here: DataVisualistion/ComicBooks

The report below is in a story-telling format starting with defining a persona and the questions, for which the data will help to find answers. 

### USER 
MARVEL Comics has a newly appointed CEO – Mrunal Tipari. Everyone is aware, there are more male superheroes than female, but no one is taking any initiative to bring a change. So, she wanted to remove this bias as this was not something that the world should be based on. To bring a diversity and remove this disparity, she wants to propose the idea and convince the Board of Directors to agree on introducing more female lead characters in comic books. To provide exact facts and figures about this issue, she assigns this task to an Editor of the company to come up with a simple presentation with visualisations based on the data they have on all comic books since 1935 which should answer below questions:
- Comic Book characters gender bifurcation.
- Gender Ratio of Comics Creators
- Where does the Female character comic books stand in best-selling records?

## Comic Books: By Men, For Men and About Men

Even in the year 2017, gender discrimination is seen everywhere. A lingering perception is seen that men have an upper hand on landing high-paying jobs and are more entitled to employment in times when jobs are scarce. For many years, comic books were only for kids. Now, it’s all walks of life. The all variety of genre and all-age materials has expanded the audience. This medium can be used to send good messages to the world. The young minds will not know the concept of gender biasing and it can help to diminish within adults. We can tell our rising generations how our perception of gender roles influence everything.

Figure 1. Gender-wise Distribution of Comic Books
</p>

Comic Books vastly under represent women. Even, the two biggest comic books publishers MARVEL and DC has only one fourth female characters of all the comic books. Although, we beat our competitor DC in the number male characters, MARVEL accounts for only 25% Female characters which is less than DC. Historically speaking, the two biggest publishers does not have an awesome relationship with women. Has much changed? Looking at each year since 1935, it is seen that the number of characters introduced each year are increasing for both the genders but still there is a lot of difference between the number of male and female characters introduced each year.

Figure 2.  Gender-Wise Trend of New Characters Introduced 1935-2013
</p>						

Despite public attempts to pivot toward diversity — none of the publisher is introducing female characters at a rate approaching gender parity. While we are certainly beating earlier ratios, new characters introduced still don’t reflect reality, where men and women each make up about half the population. The trend has steadily come closer in 2013, but each still faces a difficult-to-overcome imbalance.

Figure 3. Comparison of Gender-wise Character Appearances 1935-2013
</p>		
	
Women were substantially underrepresented among characters. Even though, the female characters are less, their appearances in other comic books or in their own comic book issues is very less compared to male characters. For few years, there are no female characters seen and even if they appear in any comic books, there appearance is half of total number of appearance of male characters.

Figure 4. Gender Ratio of Comic Creators1
</p>	

Among comic-creators, the numbers are even more discouraging. There are only 6% female comic books creators. More women comic creators should be encouraged to come up a creative female character, which can be a representation of women with which other young girls and women can relate. The change should be brought in industry and community which has unwelcoming attitudes toward women for years.

Figure 5. Top 15 Best Selling Comic Books of 2017
</p>
					
Comic books publishers like us (MARVEL) are no longer simply convenience-store singles. Today, we are blockbuster movies, fast-selling merchandise, drama-filled tv shows, and popular video games. The more these characters appear in pop culture, the more their representation matters — especially because female characters form such a small fraction of the whole. But the goal is still to see women hit the top of the charts. In 2017, only Spider Gwen comic was able to the top 15 best-selling comics. I think we know that things are excellent when we can get at least one female-led comic book title into the top 10 or even the top five monthly bestselling comic book titles.

It is all on publishers after all. So, if we publishers change our point of view, the creators will be open to all sorts of ideas.
